        <h2>Top British Dishes</h2>
        <div role="region" aria-label="fish-food" >
          <h3>Fish and Chips</h3>
          <p>
            This dish is a must try whilst you are in the UK, no matter where
            you are, you’ll be able to find a delicious plate of fish and chips.
            The very best place to eat fish and chips is in the open air, by the
            sea (just watch out for the seagulls), so if you are studying
            English at our Eastbourne school make sure you buy some and take
            them to the beach.

          <h3>Bangers and Mash</h3>
          <p>
            Also known as sausages and mash, this traditional dish consists of
            sausages and mashed potato, and is often accompanied with peas and
            gravy. This dish can usually be found on a menu in most pubs across
            the country, or can be made very easily at home.

          <h3>Full English Breakfast</h3>
          <p>
            They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, which
            is why if you are doing something physically or mentally demanding,
            such as the IELTs exam, you need to have a full English breakfast!
            This breakfast usually includes: bacon, sausages, eggs, baked beans,
            toast, mushrooms, tomatoes, hash browns and black puddings.

          <h3>Sunday Roast</h3>

            The Brits love their Sunday Roast dinners. This dish is made up of:
            roasted meat (beef, chicken, lamb or pork), roast potato, Yorkshire
            pudding, stuffing, vegetables (usually a selection of: roast
            parsnips, Brussels sprouts, peas, carrots, beans, broccoli and
            cauliflower, not necessarily all) and gravy.
